# MusicPlayer

I built this musicPlayer desktop application to play mp3 songs and create playlists.

## Functionalities
- Load .mp3 file
- Create playlist
- Load playlist
- Navigate into the song with the slider
- Go to the next song
- Go to the previous song
- Display title, artist and duration of the song.

You can run the .jar file in the folder executable.
